- This includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective paper for my final project. 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are defacto interpreted by user stories and those user stories lay out the individual tasks that a developer
needs to accomplish in order to accuratly define and produce the feature through code.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The approach taken to developing programs should be continous integration and continous development which in themselves
are core principles of agile. Practices in agile for development should include story pointing, generating user stories, 
identifing sprint length, and if the team is large enough, agile ceremonies.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It means that you are active in every stage of developing the program and that your role in the software development process
reaches other parts too and contributing to the team in more ways than just the role chose for yourself or by someone else.
